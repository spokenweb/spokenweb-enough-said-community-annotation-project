Any of the open-mikers who’ve hung out and are still up for it are more than welcome to have their day in the rain in a moment or two. I can’t encourage people enough, as well, to come over to the corner at some point if you’re going hang out for a bit. We’ve got loads of books, both Sharon’s, bill’s, and some small press offerings of various natures. You know, when I first met bill, I was doing my degree at Concordia. I went down to the stacks in what was at that time the Norris Library. Do you know there are 41 titles of bill’s in that library? Several of Sharon’s as well. But 41—you’re not going to find a lot of them in the bookstores anymore, but bill is part of a very, very vital scene, going back a good twenty odd years. [Sharon H. Nelson interacts (“Pushing thirty!”)] Pushing thirty! And they’re all still in the stacks, you know? You go down to what’s now the Webster Library, or over to the Redpath, or any other incredible institution of those varieties, you can check the stuff out because I tell you, a whole lot of innovation went into the years between then and now. Okay, so—enjoy, hang out. I should mention the coming weeks. Second in the series, Wired Words—spoken word documents prepared by Corey Frost, Colin Christie, and ga Press, that’s featuring Fortner Anderson and Neil Wiernik next week, same time, same place. I’d like to send a thought out to my future performer for the week after, Ian Stephens, is not very well and I think with all the love in the air here this evening maybe we can all share a thought with Ian. And yeah, hang out, please, as long as you’d like, and we’ll get right to a little impromptu reading in a moment. Thanks.
