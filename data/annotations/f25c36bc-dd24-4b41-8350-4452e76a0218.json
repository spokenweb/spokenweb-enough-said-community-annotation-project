Off the Boulevard, Chancey and Peter worked on for a long time. The current incarnation is a wonderful series of readings that occur each Monday night around 9 o'clock at the Bistro 4, that's the corner of Duluth and Saint Lawrence. They're curated, managed, put together by our next reader, Lee Gotham, hailing from Britain, here in Montreal now five years. I'd like you all to welcome Lee. [Audience applause. Ambient sounds (voices).] | Video Description: Closeup on event host, Fortner Anderson, looking toward the audience and addressing them through the microphone. Short grey hair. Black browline glasses. Dark collared shirt. Anderson briefly diverts attention off-stage before resuming addressing audience. Nods at conclusion of introductory marks to Lee Gotham, exiting via the left side of the frame. Camera zooms out to a medium long shot on the lone microphone, bathed in the glow of a spotlight hanging on stage right. Lee Gotham enters the stage via stage right.
