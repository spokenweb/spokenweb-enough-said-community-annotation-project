Now I don't know how many of you have been around Saint Lawrence street over the last several years—Is Chancey (?) here? Chancey? [Audience member responds.] Still in the room? Oh, he (?) just stepped out. Well, there were a couple of readings that have gone on up and down Saint Lawrence street over the several years. Off the Boulevard, Chancey and Peter worked on for a long time. The current incarnation is a wonderful series of readings that occur each Monday night around 9 o'clock at the Bistro 4, that's the corner of Duluth and Saint Lawrence. They're curated, managed, put together by our next reader, Lee Gotham, hailing from Britain, here in Montreal now five years. I'd like you all to welcome Lee. [Audience applause.
